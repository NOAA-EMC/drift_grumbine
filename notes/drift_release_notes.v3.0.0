Version 3.0.0:

Source code changes:
seaice_preaverage: (prepare the input -- 12 hour average winds)
  change to quarter-degree output from 1 degree
    -- current nominal GFS resolution
    -- approx target drift model resolution
    -- add gfs_quarter class inline (in analogy to old mrf1deg)
  add more agressive management of flag values from input files
  makefile drops unused reference to w3lib

seaice_sicedrft: (model)
  uice     -- adds a debug output of max, min velocities
  skpoints -- adds IMPLICIT none declaration (no effect)
  sk2setup -- substantial changes in order to
     read in the new ice edge files
  sk2out   -- save dir, dist to vectors and pass to kmlout 
  kmlout   -- new, kml pushpin display of drifts
  gridset  -- new, provide lat-longs for a ps grid
  sicedrift.inc -- change dlat, dlon to 1/4 degree, add parameters for
     gridset to compute its locations
  sicedrft.f    -- add variables for grid locations, call to gridset,
     add calls to movice with grid's drifts, write out unformatted 
     binary to unit 92
  makefile      -- change case of name to lower, compiler change from 
     xlf_r to ncepxlf

     
  
fixed file changes:
None

Jobs, scripts:
Change base name from MRF_ICEDRFT1 to seaice_drift

versions:
New, for Environmental Equivalence

sms:
New, for Environmental Equivalence



Implementation notes:

directories that should be deleted:
/nwprod/sorc/seaice_sicedrft.fd
/nwprod/sorc/seaice_preaverage.cd

files that should be deleted:
/nwprod/fix/
  seaice_com.ipasaiji.npoc.antarc
  seaice_com.ipasaiji.npoc.arctic
  seaice_forecast.points
  seaice_quote
  akpoints

/nwprod/jobs/JMRF_ICEDRFT1.sms.prod
/nwprod/scripts/exmrf_icedrft1.sh.sms
/nwprod/exec/seaice_preaverage
/nwprod/exec/seaice_sicedrft

Build the executables by going to seaice_drift_v3.0.0/sorc/
  and executing makeall.sh
Move them to exec directory
Changes as needed for sms, jobs scripts
